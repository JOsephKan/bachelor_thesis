## Scientific Question
1. What are the direct and indirect impacts of the cloud radiative feedback (CRF) on the behavior of the CCKWs, including phase speed, growth rate, etc.?
2. What are the impact of shallow convecting cumulus on the CCKWs behavior, including phase speed, growth rate, etc.?
3. In warming climate, the convective and radiative condition may vary. What are the potential changes of the CCKWs behavior that resulting from such changes?
